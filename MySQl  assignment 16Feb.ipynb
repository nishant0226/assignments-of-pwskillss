    "A database is a software application that allows users to store, manage, and retrieve data. It is an organized collection of data, which can be accessed and managed in various ways. Databases are used in many different types of applications, from small personal projects to large enterprise systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two types of databases, which differ in the way they store and manage data.SQL databases, or relational databases, are based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables with columns and rows. Each table represents a type of entity, such as customers, orders, or products, and each column represents a specific attribute of that entity. SQL databases use structured query language (SQL) to interact with the data, allowing users to query, insert, update, and delete data in a relational way. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in various formats, such as key-value pairs, document-oriented, column-family, and graph databases. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured data, which may not fit well into a traditional relational database. Unlike SQL databases, NoSQL databases do not use a fixed schema, allowing data to be stored and retrieved in a more flexible manner. NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages, which are specific to each database type. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, and Amazon DynamoDB."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a set of SQL commands used to define the structure and schema of a database. DDL commands are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of common DDL commands and their uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create new database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and sequences. For example, to create a new table called \"employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, and salary, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "DROP: The DROP command is used to delete existing database objects such as tables, views, and indexes. For example, to delete the \"employees\" table you created above, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or removing columns from a table. For example, to add a new column for employee email to the \"employees\" table, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ADD email VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the data in a table, but not the table itself. For example, to remove all the data from the \"employees\" table you created above, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "In summary, DDL commands are used to define the structure and schema of a database, and to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and sequences. The CREATE command is used to create new objects, the DROP command is used to delete objects, the ALTER command is used to modify objects, and the TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the data from a table."

    "A database management system (DBMS) allows users to interact with data by executing various SQL commands. DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, which is a set of SQL commands used to insert, update, and delete data in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of common DML commands and their uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT: The INSERT command is used to insert new data into a table. For example, to add a new employee record to the \"employees\" table, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (1, 'John Smith', 50000);\n",
    "This statement will insert a new record with an ID of 1, a name of \"John Smith\", and a salary of 50000 into the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE: The UPDATE command is used to modify existing data in a table. For example, to update the salary of an employee with an ID of 1 in the \"employees\" table, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE employees SET salary = 55000 WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "This statement will update the salary of the employee with an ID of 1 to 55000.\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE: The DELETE command is used to delete data from a table. For example, to delete an employee record with an ID of 1 from the \"employees\" table, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "This statement will delete the employee record with an ID of 1 from the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DML commands are used to manipulate the data in a database. The INSERT command is used to insert new data into a table, the UPDATE command is used to modify existing data, and the DELETE command is used to delete data from a table."

    "Let's assume we have a table named \"employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, salary, and department. We can use the SELECT command to retrieve the names and salaries of all employees in the Sales department with a salary greater than 50,000, as follows:\n",

    "In a relational database, a primary key and a foreign key are used to establish relationships between tables.\n",

    "For example, in a table named \"employees\", the \"id\" column can be set as the primary key. This means that each employee record in the table will have a unique \"id\" value that identifies that employee.\n",

    "In this example, the \"employee_id\" column in the \"orders\" table is a foreign key that refers to the \"id\" column in the \"employees\" table. This means that each order record will have a value in the \"employee_id\" column that corresponds to the \"id\" value of an employee record in the \"employees\" table. This relationship is enforced by the FOREIGN KEY constraint, which ensures that only valid employee IDs are allowed in the \"employee_id\" column of the \"orders\" table."
