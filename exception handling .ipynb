    "An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. Exceptions are raised when an error or exceptional condition is encountered that the code cannot handle. When an exception is raised, the Python interpreter looks for a handler to catch the exception and handle it appropriately.difference between exceptions and syntax errors in Python is that exceptions are runtime errors that occur when the code is executed, while syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during parsing of the code and prevent the code from being executed at all. Syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules of the Python language, such as a missing parenthesis, a misspelled keyword, or an invalid syntax."
