    "read(), readline(), and readlines() are three methods that are used to read data from a file in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "read(): This method reads the entire contents of a file as a single string. It takes an optional argument which specifies the maximum number of bytes to read. If no argument is given, the entire file is read.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Open the file in read mode\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",

    "\n",
    "# Print the data\n",
    "print(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the file\n",
    "file.close()\n",

    "# Open the file in read mode\n",

    "    line = file.readline()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the file\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "readlines(): This method reads all the lines of a file into a list of strings. Each string in the list represents a single line from the file.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Open the file in read mode\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",

It ensures that the file is closed properly after use, without the need for explicit calls to close(). This prevents potential errors and resource leaks that may occur due to a missed close() call.
